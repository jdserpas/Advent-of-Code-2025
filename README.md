# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) programming challenges.

## Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in its own folder (e.g., `day-1/`). Inside each folder, you'll typically find:

- `solution.py`: My solution script for the day's puzzle
- `input.txt`: The actual puzzle input
- `example.txt`: Example input provided by the puzzle

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired day's folder:
   ```bash
   cd day-1
   ```
2. Run the solution script (Python 3 required):
   ```bash
   python3 solution.py
   ```

You may need to adjust the script if it expects input from a file or standard input.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that are released daily in December. It's a fun way to practice coding and problem-solving skills!
